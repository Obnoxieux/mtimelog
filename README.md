## mtimelog

## Project description
gtimelog is a time tracking utility built unapologetically for macOS. It draws heavy inspiration (and sort of steals the name) from the similarly scoped GNOME application [gtimelog](https://gtimelog.org/).

Unlike some bigger projects, this aims to be a very small utility application that makes your (read: my) life easier in a specific use case.
